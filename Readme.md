# 🧠 Advanced Text Summarizer using Transformers (BART/T5)

This project demonstrates a powerful **NLP-based Text Summarizer** built using **Transformer models** like BART or T5 from HuggingFace. It takes long texts and generates concise summaries that retain the meaning and context, similar to human-level summarization.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Summarize long paragraphs intelligently
- Uses **pre-trained Transformer models** (`BART` or `T5`)
- Simple and clean interface (CLI or script-based)
- Extendable for web apps, document summarization, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Torch (PyTorch)**
- **NLTK** *(optional preprocessing)*
- **Jupyter/VS Code**
